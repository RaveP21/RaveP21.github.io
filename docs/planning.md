# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
People who will want to move to Bristol, people who want to know more about their neighborhood in Bristol and propective Bristol entrepaneurs all have a few things in common. Needing to filter, understand and evaluate information and data regarding to specific wards in Bristol.

### Business benefits
Easy accessability of information on things like regional crime rate, house hold income, mental health and several other relavent information in well formed diagrams and charts.

### Options Considered
Other Options such as crystalroof.co.uk has more information in all of the wards than we have accessible however they put these behind a premium paid service. 

### Expected Risks
When competing with services like these the limitation on data when comparing various Bristol Open Data databases paired with beginner level knowledge compared to a funded Business that assumably localy sources their data and is able to create higher complexity zones and tools will potentially cast our project in a negative light due to the simplicity or any lack of features. However building a project without profit in mind will boost success.
